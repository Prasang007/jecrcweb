                        The Departments of Electronics & Communication Engineering and Electrical Engineering are the major departments involving number of laboratories with a diversified variety of equipment being the core branches and with laboratories focusing on fundamental aspects of Electronics & Communication Engineering. In order to cope up with the requirement of industries, the departments also have laboratories with latest technologies. Students have an open access in the laboratories, to understand as well as apply their knowledge to explore their engineering skills. The departments have team of highly motivated and dedicated faculty members to the cause of academics and striving to do the best in the interest of the college and the students. Most of the faculty members are actively involved in research work and regularly publishing their research papers in Journals and Conferences.

The  greatest  asset  of  the  department  is  its highly  motivated  and  learned  faculty.  The  available diversity of expertise of the faculty with the support of  the  other  technical  staff  prepares  the  students  to work  in  the  global  multicultural  environment.  The department   not   only   aims   to   make   our   students technically  sound  and  knowledgeable  but  also  to nurture  their  wisdom  and  make  them  a  better  and responsible   human   being.   The   graduates   of   the Electronics   &   Communication   Stream   have   been selected by some of the world’s leading corporations &   as   well   as   by   most   of   the   leading   Indian counterparts.   We   hope   that   we   will   continue   to deliver our best to serve the society and mankind. It is  also  expected  that  our  students  will  continue  to pass on the skills which they have developed during their stay at this department to the whole of the world for a better society.
