                        The department of Computer Engineering is one of the most sought after departments in the college. It is well equipped with the latest infrastructure and laboratories. 
                        The department regularly arranges seminars, guest lectures, and workshops by industry experts for students and staff. The department offers add-on courses to cope with the latest trends in technology. The institute has signed MOUs with leading IT industries such as Infosys, TCS, Microsoft, Amdocs, Accenture, Cognizant, Thought Works and National Entrepreneurship Network, to promote Industry-Institute interaction. The department has good interaction with these industries.
                        Every year about 20% of the final year students secure admission for higher studies at renowned Universities abroad and institutes of repute in India. Off late a good number of students are emerging as Entrepreneurs.

The Department of Information and Technology has recorded consistent improvement in its academic, research and placement performance. It offers a range of innovatively designed programs whose curricula are constantly updated to meet the changing requirement of the industry and also to meet the needs of major stakeholders. To accomplish these goals, we provide a coding environment and proper guidance so that synergies can be created in these  areas, and our students can aspire to become job seekers to job creators. Our basic mission is to continue to do what we have always done; develop the students with integrity and values; also, to give our students the best opportunities and  outcome based education. 
I believe that our students have been well accepted in their job profiles and have consistently exceeded expectations of the corporate world which can be seen as most of our alumni are studying and giving their best in various esteemed institutions worldwide.
During study at the department, the students are encouraged to get hands-on experience in the corporate world through internship projects with reputed organizations. In their curriculum they are encouraged to take up mini projects to supplement theoretical knowledge with practical experience. They also undertake projects benefiting local industries or dealing with local problems. These projects enable them to understand the relevance of working in a group and also help them to realize the finer aspects and importance of teamwork.

The curriculum is taught by  distinguished faculty combining academic excellence and real world experience with dedication and commitment.
We are encouraged to see many industries coming back to our Institution, which reinforces our suitability to the dynamic corporate world.
