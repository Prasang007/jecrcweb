                        Department of Mechanical Engineering is established in year 2000. Department offers Bachelor of Technology degree with an intake of 210 students. We have well qualified and dedicated faculty and staff members. The dedication and hard work of the faculty and staff members have given fruitful results with our students securing ranks at University examination consistently.
Department have 13 well equipped laboratories. A separate CENTRE OF EXALLECE has been established with various software’s such as SOLID WORKS, ANSYS, COMSOL, Pro-ENGINEER, AutoCAD, MATLAB etc. A wide selection of projects, seminars and training facilities besides technical visits to industrial enterprises and specialized lectures from industry specialists generates enormous potential and confidence among the students enabling them to independently handle the life size problems in their engineering careers. Many MoU’s are signed with various industries offering opportunity to the students to learn working culture of industry. The Department also has a well-established workshop for training in Smithy, Carpentry, Welding, Fitting and Machine tools.
SAE –BAJA INDIA Collegiate club is also established under which students of all departments are enthusiastically taking part in making the SAE BAJA vehicle. Our students are excellent at National level and State level competitions like Jaipur Street karting Cup, IKC Kolhapur.

Mechanical engineers use the principles of energy, materials and mechanics to design and manufacture machines and devices of all types. They create the process and systems that drive technology and industry. The faculty aims at putting extra ordinary effort towards motivating the students in solving actual industrial problems by undertaking various projects, industrial visits and in-plant training. The Department is actively associated in grooming the engineering graduates in Mechanical Engineering by nurturing them with inputs from various basic and specialized subjects including Production, Industrial, Thermal and Design Engineering. A wide selection of projects, seminars and training facilities besides technical visits to industrial enterprises and specialized lectures from industry specialists generates enormous potential and confidence among the students enabling them to independently handle the life size problems in their engineering careers. The faculty members of the department have organized national and international conferences, The Department has well equipped laboratories for the graduate students. Some of these laboratories are Strength of Materials Lab, Material Science Lab, Kinematics/ Dynamics of Machines Lab, Heat Transfer Lab, Production Lab, Thermal Lab, Fluid Mechanics Lab, Fluid Machines Lab, CAD/CAM Lab, etc.</p>
